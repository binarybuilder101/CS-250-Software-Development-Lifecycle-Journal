**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

To effectively interpret and implement user needs, it all begins with understanding the user and their needs. Direct engagement through interviews, observations, and usability testing can aid in uncovering these needs. User stories play a critical role in this process by capturing the user's perspective in a structured format. These stories break down the user's needs into concrete system requirements and lead to the design of solutions that can fully address those needs.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

In approaching program development, I embrace an Agile mindset that prioritizes iterative progress and responsiveness to change. Agile practices such as iterative development with frequent releases and the use of cross-functional, self-organizing teams are fundamental. Continuous integration and delivery help ensure that assumptions get validated early, and adjustments can be made quickly according to feedback. Looking ahead, I aim to further integrate Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban into my work to maintain focus and efficiency.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a valuable team member in software development involves embodying essential qualities and practices. Communication and collaboration are significant, along with a commitment to share information and actively seek feedback from other team members. Good team members demonstrate ownership and accountability for tasks, which helps build trust and synergy within the team. Additionally, maintaining an open and flexible mindset when problem-solving is necessary to identify the best solutions to challenges.
